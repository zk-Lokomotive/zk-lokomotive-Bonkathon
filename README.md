## Introduction

* This project aims to create a secure and efficient file transfer system bridging Solana and Ethereum networks by integrating ZK, Arweave, and Wormhole. ZK ensures file integrity and privacy, Arweave facilitates file storage, and Wormhole enables cross-chain token and data transfer.

This project encompasses file transfer scenarios within the **Solana-Solana** and **Solana-EVM** ecosystems. 

---

In the Solana-Solana file transfer scenario, WebRTC is employed instead of Wormhole, with the endpoints (IDs) being the users' wallet addresses on the Solana network. Within the Solana network, the file transfer process operates as follows: RSA keys are utilized to encrypt AES keys, facilitating their secure exchange between the two clients. Subsequently, the file is encrypted using the exchanged AES key and decrypted accordingly by the recipient.

---

On the other hand, the architecture undergoes a significant shift for file transfer between Solana and EVM-based networks. In this scenario, I establish a bridge between Solana and EVM networks. The file is encrypted with zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) and transformed into a token in exchange for tokens. This token, encapsulating the ZK proof of the file's integrity, traverses the Solana-EVM bridge via Wormhole. Upon reception, the recipient validates the ZK proof to claim the file. Additionally, I retrieve the file from Arweave, ensuring its integrity based on the verified proof.

In summary, this project implements a sophisticated file transfer mechanism, leveraging different technologies for seamless communication between Solana-Solana and Solana-EVM networks. Through meticulous encryption, tokenization, and validation processes, it ensures the secure and verifiable exchange of files while maintaining compatibility and interoperability across disparate blockchain ecosystems.

## Motivation:

Providing the amount of our data continues rapidly in the technological singularity. Traditional file formats often lack adequate privacy and security, especially when it comes to sensitive data. File services run on a central server, creating the risk of data breaches and privacy violations. We offer a different solution to this than traditional breaks, by combining the powerful capacities and polynomials of mathematics and the decentralized generality of Solana, thus challenging the trilemma.

## Solution:

Adopting a decentralized approach to file transfer, utilizing the principles of zero-knowledge proofs (zkSNARKs), can significantly enhance privacy and security. This method allows for the verification of file transmission without revealing the contents of the files to the network or a third party.

## Scenario Secure Research File Sharing

**Scene: Biomedical Research University**

**Characters:**

    Alice: Biomedical researcher
    Bob: Collaborator

**Solana-Solana File Transfer:**

Location: Research Lab at the Biomedical Research University

Action:

    Alice prepares to share a research file with Bob securely within the Solana network.

Dialogue:

    Alice: Hi Bob, I've completed the analysis on our latest research data. I need your input on it.
    Bob: Sure Alice, I'm ready to collaborate. How should we proceed?
    Alice: We'll transfer the file securely using Solana's network. I'll encrypt the file with RSA keys and share the AES key with you.
    Bob: Sounds good. Let's get started.

Process:

    Alice encrypts the research file using RSA keys and prepares to share the AES key with Bob for decryption.
    Alice shares the AES key securely with Bob using their Solana wallet addresses as identifiers.
    Bob receives the AES key and decrypts the file, enabling him to review the research data.

Outcome:

    The research file is securely transferred from Alice to Bob within the Solana network, ensuring privacy and integrity.

---

**Solana-EVM File Transfer:**

Location: Research Lab at the Biomedical Research University

Action:

    Alice needs to share a research file with collaborators on an EVM-based network.

Dialogue:

    Alice: Bob, we have collaborators on an EVM-based network who need access to our research data. We'll need to transfer it securely.
    Bob: Understood. How do we proceed with this transfer?
    Alice: We'll use a bridge between Solana and the EVM network. I'll encrypt the file with zero-knowledge proofs and tokenize it for transfer.
    Bob: Got it. Let's make sure everything is set up correctly.

Process:

    Alice encrypts the research file with zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) and converts it into a token for transfer.
    Alice initiates the transfer of the tokenized file through the Solana-EVM bridge via Wormhole.
    Collaborators on the EVM-based network receive the token and validate the ZK proof to claim the file.
    Alice retrieves the file from Arweave to ensure its integrity based on the verified proof.

Outcome:

    The research file is securely transferred from Alice to collaborators on the EVM-based network, maintaining privacy and integrity across different blockchain ecosystems.

### Benefits:

    Privacy: ZK encryption guarantees that sensitive data can only be accessed by Alice and authorized collaborators.
    Integrity: ZK proofs confirm that research data has not been altered in a secure environment.
    Traceability: Solana and EVM blockchains provide a permanent record of transactions.
    Trust: The protocol uses both cryptographic techniques and blockchain technology to share research data in a trusted way.
    Wormhole Integration: Seamless communication between Solana and Ethereum allows collaborators and stakeholders to be on different blockchains.

### Enhancements

    Access Control: Access permission efficiency can be increased with advanced smart contracts in Solana.
    User Interface: An easy-to-use web or mobile interface to follow the entire process.
    Data Analytics: Analytics operations on data stored in Ethereum & Solana.

use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use borsh::{BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};
use std::{
    io::Write,
};

#[derive(AnchorDeserialize, AnchorSerialize)]
pub struct PostMessageData {
    /// Unique nonce for this message
    pub nonce: u32,

    /// Message payload
    pub payload: Vec<u8>,

    /// Commitment Level required for an attestation to be produced

```

- The provided Rust struct ZkFile and its methods demonstrate the usage of ZK to encrypt and prove files' integrity. from_bytes function encrypts a file content using ZK, while to_data function converts a ZkFile object to ZkFileData format.

```rust

use ipfs_api::IpfsClient;

fn upload_file(client: &IpfsClient, file_content: &[u8]) -> Result<String> {
    let mut add_result = client.add(file_content)?;
    Ok(add_result.hash.to_string())
}
```

- The provided Rust function upload_file demonstrates the usage of IPFS-http-client to interact with IPFS. It uploads file content to IPFS and returns the IPFS hash.

### Connection Overview

    File content is encrypted using ZKFile, generating a ZK proof.
    Encrypted file is uploaded to Arweave, obtaining an Arweave hash.
    ZkFile object, Arweave hash, and other metadata are converted to ZKFileData format.
    ZKFileData object is transferred to the recipient using Wormhole bridge.

git clone https://github.com/briansmith/crypto-bench && cd crypto-bench && cargo update && cargo +nightly bench
```

You must use Rust Nightly because `cargo bench` is used for these benchmarks,
and only Right Nightly supports `cargo bench`.

You don't need to run `cargo build`, and in fact `cargo build` does not do
anything useful for this crate.

`./cargo +nightly test` runs one iteration of every benchmark for every
implementation. This is useful for quickly making sure that a change to the
benchmarks does not break them. Do this before submitting a pull request.

`cargo update` in the workspace root will update all the libraries to the
latest version.

`cargo +nightly bench -p crypto_bench_ring` runs all the tests for [_ring_](https://github.com/briansmith/ring).

* Decentralized Verification: The verification process, including the checking of zero-knowledge proofs, is performed on a blockchain network (e.g., Solana). This decentralized approach eliminates the need for a trusted third party, enhancing the security and privacy of the file transfer.

* Efficient Data Storage on Blockchain: To maintain efficiency and minimize blockchain storage requirements, only essential data (e.g., proofs, hashes) are stored on-chain. The actual file remains with the sender and recipient, ensuring privacy.

* Server: The system operates on a peer-to-peer basis, with each participant running the ZK File Transfer client. This design supports direct, secure file transfers without intermediaries.

https://github.com/virjilakrum/zk-lokomotive

- WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that enables Web applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary. The set of standards that comprise WebRTC makes it possible to share data and perform teleconferencing peer-to-peer, without requiring that the user install plug-ins or any other third-party software.

      WebRTC Configuration: Use the RTCPeerConnection API to configure the WebRTC connection. Include STUN/TURN servers in the configuration to handle NAT traversal.
      Data Channels: Use RTCDataChannel for transferring the encrypted AES key, zk-SNARK proof, and Arweave hash. This channel can also be used for the actual file transfer if not using Arweave.
      Signaling Implementation: Implement a simple signaling mechanism using WebSockets or any real-time communication library. This is for exchanging WebRTC offer, answer, and ICE candidates.
