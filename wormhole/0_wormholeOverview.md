# Wormhole

In the previous chapter, we established concepts like xDapps, xData and xAssets. In this chapter, we'll focus on the inner workings of the Wormhole ecosystem and how they power these ideas.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clear understanding of what Wormhole is, what its key components are and how each component comes together to create a powerful, new cross-chain ecosystem.
